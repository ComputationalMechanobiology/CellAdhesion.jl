CellAdhesion is a software package written in the Julia programming language that provides tools for modeling binding-unbinding dynamics of cell adhesion molecules.
Features include:

- Junctions life-span can be computed for different loading histories

- Different models for computing the binding and unbinding probabilities are implemented

- Junctions with different adhesion molecules, thus bonds with different properties, can be modeled

- Dynamics of junctions with bond clusters can be implemented
